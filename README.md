# RockPaperScissors
A Rock Paper Scissors game taking user input via webcam

Used teachable machine to create a model to differentiate between for differnt visual inputs : rock, paper, scissors and nothing.This is nessecary for the game to interpret an input from the webcam feed to be used to determie a winner.

Created the first version of the RockPaperScissors game. The script takes a typed user input and compares it to a random choice made by the computer through the use of several if-else statements. The game then displays the winner of the game and how many games have been played so far. The user can then decide to play up to 2 more games, or can exit if they wish, through the use of a while loop.
